                        Nintendo starring their mascot, Mario. It is the
                        central series of the greater Mario franchise. At
                        least one Super Mario game has been released for every
                        major Nintendo video game console. However, there
                        have also been a number of <i>Super Mario</i> video
                        games released on non-Nintendo gaming platforms.
                        <sup>[1]</sup> There are more than 20 games in
                        the series.

                        The <i>Super Mario</i> games are set primarily in the
                        fictional Mushroom Kingdom, typically with Mario as the
                        player character. He is usually joined by his brother,
                        Luigi, and often by other members of the Mario cast. As
                        platform games, they involve the player character
                        running and jumping across platforms and atop enemies
                        in themed levels. The games have simple plots,
                        typically with Mario and Luigi rescuing the kidnapped
                        Princess Peach from the primary antagonist, Bowser.
                        The first game in the series, Super Mario Bros.,
                        released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
                        in 1985, established the series' core gameplay
                        concepts and elements. These include a multitude of
                        power-ups and items that give the character special
                        powers such as fireball-throwing and size-changing.

                        The <i>Super Mario</i> series is part of the greater
                        <i>Mario</i> franchise, which includes other video game
                        genres and media such as film, television, printed
                        media, and merchandise. More than 380 million copies
                        of <i>Super Mario</i> games have been sold worldwide,
                        making it the fifth-bestselling video game series,
                        behind the larger Mario franchise, the puzzle series
                        Tetris, the Pok√©mon video games, and first-person
                        shooter series Call of Duty.<sup>[3]</sup>

                        The objective of the game is to progress through levels
                        by defeating enemies, collecting items and solving
                        puzzles without dying. Power-up use is integral to
                        the series. The series has installments featuring
                        both two and three-dimensional gameplay. In the 2D
                        games, the player character (usually Mario) jumps on
                        platforms and enemies while avoiding their attacks and
                        moving to the right of the scrolling screen. 2D
                        Super Mario game levels have single-exit objectives,
                        which must be reached within a time limit and lead
                        to the next sequential level. <i>Super Mario Bros</i>
                        3 introduced the overworld, a map of nonlinear
                        levels that branches according to the player's
                        choice.<sup>[4]</sup><i> Super Mario World</i>
                        introduced levels with multiple exits.

                    <p>
                        3D installments in the series have had two
                        subgenres: open world exploration based games
                        and more linear 3D games with a predetermined path.
                        <sup>[5]</sup>Levels in the open world games, 64,
                        <i>Sunshine</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>, allow the player
                        to freely explore multiple enclosed environments in
                        360-degree movement. As the game progresses,
                        more environments become accessible.<sup>[6]</sup>
                        The linear 3D games, <i>Galaxy</i>, <i>Galaxy 2</i>,
                        <i>3D Land</i> and <i>3D World</i>, feature more
                        fixed camera angles and a predetermined path to a
                        single goal.

                    <p>
                        The series often features the option to play as
                        characters other than Mario, usually Luigi. Earlier
                        games have offered an alternating multiplayer mode
                        in which the second player controls Luigi on their
                        turn. Luigi is often only playable by player one in
                        a second, more challenging iteration of the base game,
                        such as in <i>The Lost Levels, Galaxy 2,
                        New Super Luigi U</i> and the special worlds
                        in 3D Land; these feature lower gravity and reduced
                        friction for Luigi. Later games allow four player
                        simultaneous play. Playable characters other than Mario
                        and Luigi have included Toads, Peach, Yoshi, Wario,
                        Rosalina, Miis, Toadette, Nabbit, Daisy, and Bowser Jr.
                        Characters are sometimes differentiated by special
                        abilities. <i>Super Mario</i> Maker includes costumes
                        that depict many more characters (<i>Super Mario</i>
                        Maker 2 includes only a Link costume).

                    <p>
                        Mushroom power-ups appear in almost every
                        <i>Super Mario</i> game. The most iconic of these is
                        the <i>Super Mushroom</i>.[7][8] The Super Mushroom
                        increases the character's size, turning them
                        into a "Super" variant, and allows them to break
                        certain blocks. When hit by an enemy, the character
                        reverts to their smaller size instead of losing
                        a life.<sup>[7]</sup> When the character is in
                        their "Super" form, most blocks that would
                        contain a Super Mushroom instead offer a more
                        powerful power-up such as the Fire Flower. The
                        Super Mushroom is similar in appearance to the
                        <i>Amanita muscaria</i>, with an ivory stalk
                        below a most commonly red and white (originally
                        red and orange) spotted cap. Created by chance,
                        Shigeru Miyamoto stated in an interview
                        that beta tests of <i>Super Mario Bros</i>.
                        proved Mario too tall, so the development
                        team implemented mushrooms to grow and shrink
                        Mario.[9] Different variants of mushroom power-ups
                        appear in the series. For example, Super Mario Bros.:
                        <i>The Lost Levels</i> introduces
                        <i>Poison Mushroom</i>, which causes damage when
                        collected; and New Super Mario Bros. introduces the
                        Mini Mushroom, which shrinks the character to
                        miniature size; and the Mega Mushroom, grows the
                        character into a towering, invulnerable giant who
                        destroys enemies and the environment by running through
                        them.[<sup>10]</sup>

                        <i>Super Mario Bros.</i> 3 introduces suits to the
                        <i>Super Mario</i> series, many of which are based
                        on animals or Mario enemies. The Raccoon Suit
                        (provisioned by a Super Leaf) and the Tanooki Suit
                        each provide the character with a tail that enables
                        flight. In addition, the Tanooki Suit lets the
                        character spontaneously change into an invincible
                        statue for about five seconds. <i>Super Mario Bros.
                        3</i> includes a Hammer Bros. suit, which allows Mari
                         and Luigi to throw hammers as projectiles to defeat
                         enemies at a distance. Other suits in later games in
                         the series include the Frog Suit, Penguin Suit, Cat
                         Suit, Boomerang Suit, and Bee Suit.

                        projectiles. The Fire Flower, introduced in
                        <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, transforms the character
                        into a Fire variant who can throw bouncing fireballs
                        at enemies.<i>Galaxy</i> is the first 3D
                        <i>Super Mario</i> game to have the Fire Flower.
                        In <i>Land</i> and <i>Maker 2</i>,
                        the Superball is a bouncing ball obtained
                        from a Super Flower, which the character can
                        use to defeat enemies and collect coins. The Ice
                        Flower transforms the character into an Ice
                        variant who can shoot balls of ice as
                        projectiles similar to those of the Fire
                        Flower; they freeze enemies in blocks of ice
                        that can be used as platforms or thrown as
                        projectiles, as seen in <i>New Super Mario Bros.</i>
                        Wii and New <i>Super Mario Bros. U.</i>
                        <sup>[11]</sup> In Galaxy, the Ice Flower turns Mario
                        or Luigi into ice and lets him walk on lava or water
                        for a limited time by freezing the surface. Lastly,
                        New Super Mario Bros. 2's Gold Flower lets Mario or
                        Luigi turn bricks into coins and earn bonus coins for
                        defeating enemies.

                        Koopa Shells serve as a major projectile in the series
                        featuring since the original game. The character can
                        throw them to defeat enemies, collect coins,
                        and activate the functions of blocks. Power-ups
                        are available for Yoshi to breathe fire in
                        <i>World, Yoshi's Island,</i> and <i>64 DS,</i>
                        breathe freezing air and spit seeds in Yoshi's Island,
                        spit out enemies in the World games,
                        and spit juice in <i>Sunshine</i>.
                        Other power-ups let the character throw bombs,
                        boomerangs, and baseballs and shoot cannonballs.
                        In <i>Odyssey</i>, Mario can possess characters,
                        some of which can launch various projectiles.
                        Flying shoot 'em up gameplay also appears in the
                        series. Mario pilots the armed Sky
                        Pop biplane and Marine Pop submarine in <i>Land</i>.

                        Apart from automated objects in levels that may

                        animals and vehicles have appeared that the player
                        controls. Mario's dinosaur friend Yoshi has appeared
                        as a mount to the player character in several 
                        <i>Super Mario</i> games since<i>Super Mario World.</i>
                        In Yoshi's Island and 64 DS, instead of the player
                        character merely riding on Yoshi's back, Yoshi
                        is the player character. Yoshis generally have
                        abilities including eating enemies, flying, and
                        breathing fire. Miyamoto had originally wished for
                        Mario to be able to ride a dinosaur in
                        <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, but this wasn't possible
                        due to the technical restraints of the system.
