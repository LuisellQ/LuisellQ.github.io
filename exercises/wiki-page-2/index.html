            From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
        </p>
        <p>
            Graphic design is a profession,<sup>[2]</sup> academic discipline
            <sup>[3][4][5]</sup> and applied art whose activity consists in
            projecting visual communications intended to transmit specific
            messages to social groups, with specific objectives.
            <sup>[6]</sup> Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of
            design<sup>[1]</sup> and of the fine arts. Its practice involves
            creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital
            tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate
            visually.
        </p>
        <p>
            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is
            that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the 
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages.
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and 
            the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and 
            imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what
            language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a 
            customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established 
            linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that
            graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic
            manifestation.<sup>[7]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example,
            it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be 
            applied in the aviation world<sup>[8]</sup> or space exploration.
            <sup>[9][10]</sup> In this sense, in some countries graphic design
            is related as only associated with the production of sketches and
            drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small
            part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,<sup>[11]</sup> 
            graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of 
            rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of 
            consumer culture in the Industrial Revolution. From there it 
            emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated 
            with advertising in the 19th century<sup>[12]</sup> and its
            evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the
            rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the demand
            for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly 
            because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay
            attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers 
            who develop them.<sup>[13]</sup>

            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the
            term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,<sup>[14]</sup> although
            it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of 
            <i>Organized Labor</i>, a publication of the Labor Unions of 
            San Francisco, in an article about technical education for 
            printers:<sup>[15]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            An Enterprising Trades Union
        </p>
        <p>
            … The admittedly high standard of intelligence which prevails 
            among printers is an assurance that with the elemental principles
            of design at their finger ends many of them will grow in knowledge
            and develop into specialists in graphic design and decorating. …
        </p>
        <p>
            A decade later, the 1917–1918 course catalog of the California
            School of Arts & Crafts advertised a course titled Graphic Design 
            and Lettering, which replaced one called Advanced Design and
            Lettering. Both classes were taught by Frederick Meyer.

            In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion
            of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the 
            distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art
            has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles,
            practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client.
            In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and 
            services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to 
            information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts
            that document the human experience."<sup>[17]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The definition of the graphic designer profession is relatively
            recent concerning its preparation, activity, and objectives.
            Although there is no consensus on an exact date when graphic design
            emerged, some date it back to the Interwar period. Others 
            understand that it began to be identified as such by the late
            19th century.<sup>[11]</sup>

        </p>
        <p>
            It can be argued that graphic communications with specific purposes
            have their origins in Paleolithic cave paintings and the birth of
            written language in the third millennium BCE. However, the 
            differences in working methods, auxiliary sciences, and required
            raining are such that it is not possible to clearly identify the 
            current graphic designer with prehistoric man, the 15th-century
            xylographer, or the lithographer of 1890.
        </p>
        <p>
            The diversity of opinions stems from some considering any graphic
            manifestation as a product of graphic design, while others only 
            recognize those that arise as a result of the application of an
            industrial production model—visual manifestations that have been
            "projected" to address various needs: productive, symbolic, 
            ergonomic, contextual, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, the evolution of graphic design as a practice and 
            profession has been closely linked to technological innovations,
            social needs, and the visual imagination of professionals.
            <sup>[18]</sup> Graphic design has been practiced in various 
            forms throughout history; in fact, good examples of graphic design
            date back to manuscripts from ancient China, Egypt, and Greece.
            As printing and book production developed in the 15th century, 
            advances in graphic design continued over the subsequent centuries,
            with composers or typographers often designing pages according to
            established type.<sup>[11]</sup>
