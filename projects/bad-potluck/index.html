        <h2><b>Instructions</b></h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Macarons Shells</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Line two baking sheets with parchment cut to size so that they
                lie flat and set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, stir together almond flour and powdered
                sugar. Using a fine mesh sieve, sift onto a sheet of parchment
                paper or into another bowl. Scrape the bottom of the sieve
                with a spatula and discard any remaining large bits of almond
                flour. Set aside.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat egg
                whites on low-medium speed until it becomes frothy like
                cappuccino foam. Slowly sprinkle in 1-2 tablespoons of
                granulated sugar at a time and beat on medium speed between
                each addition. When all the sugar has been combined, keep
                beating at medium-high speed until the meringue reaches soft
                peaks. Add the gel food colouring at this point. Continue
                beating until the meringue reaches stiff peaks.  
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>

                width="800"
               
            >
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add half of the sifted almond flour mixture into the meringue
                and fold with a spatula until roughly incorporated. Fold in
                the rest of the almond flour until roughly combined.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Smear the batter against the sides of the bowl to deflate
                air out of the batter. Scoop it all back up with your
                spatula and fold a few times. Repeat this motion about 3-4
                times and regularly check if the batter is at the correct
                consistency by scooping up some batter with your spatula and
                letting it fall back down into the bowl. If the batter
                smoothly ribbons off the spatula without breaking, it's ready.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>

                width="800"
            >
        <ol>
            <li>
                Transfer the batter to a piping back fitted with a small
                round piping tip. Hold the bag perpendicular to the baking
                sheet, slightly above the surface, and squeeze the batter
                out, staying in the same spot, and let the batter move
                outwards into a circle by itself. Do a small, circular
                flick with the piping tip to stop piping.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Lift and drop the baking sheets onto the counter a few
                times to bring air bubbles to the surface. Use a toothpick
                to pop any visible air bubbles. Let the macarons rest on
                the counter for about 1 hour they are slightly dry
                to the touch.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 290°F. Bake macarons
                one tray at a time for about 15 minutes or until the
                tops are just barely wobbly when pushed and bottoms peel
                off the parchment cleanly. Let cool completely on the
                baking sheet.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <h3><b>Strawberry Jam Filling</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small saucepan, heat frozen strawberries and sugar
                on medium heat until it boils, stirring occasionally and
                mash the softened strawberries to release their juices.
                Let it boil for about 10 minutes or until it becomes
                thick and jammy. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Push the jam through a fine mesh sieve into a small
                container to cool completely before transferring to a
                piping bag. Discard any remaining strawberry pulp.
            </li>
            <br>
        </ol>
        <h3><b>Cream Cheese Filling</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, use an electric mixer to beat
                cream cheese until smooth. Add in the powdered sugar
                and mix on low until combined. Add in the vanilla extract
                and continue beating on medium-high speed until it
                becomes smooth and creamy. Transfer frosting to a
                piping bag fitted with a small round or star tip.
            </li>
             <br>
        </ol>

        <h2><b>ASSEMBLING THE MACARONS</b></h2>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Match macarons up into similarly sized and shaped pairs.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Pipe a ring of cream cheese frosting around the outer
                edge of each macaron. Pipe a dollop of strawberry jam
                into the middle of the ring. Gently press another
                 macaron on top to sandwich.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Drizzle melted white chocolate across the tops of
                the macarons and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs
                before the chocolate hardens.
            </li>
             <br>
        </ol>
        <h3><b>Notes</b></h3>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Strawberry jam: You can use fresh strawberries instead of
                frozen. Just add 1-2 tablespoons of water to help them come
                to a boil. Or you can skip this altogether and use a 
                store-bought strawberry jam.
